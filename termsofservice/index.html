              2.1 We may update or amend these Terms from time to time. Any
              material changes will be notified by email or a prominent notice
              on our website. Your continued use of the Services after any
              updates constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.

              2.2 You must be at least 18 years old (or the legal age in your
              jurisdiction) to use the Services.
            </p>

            <p>
              2.3 You may only use the Services for lawful purposes and in
              accordance with these Terms.

              the Services without our prior written consent.
            </p>

            <p>
              2.5 <span class="strong">Free Tier &amp; Fair Use</span>. Where we
              offer free access (currently up to three requests with four output
              variations per request), this allocation is limited to one per

              access if we suspect abuse, fraud, or misuse.

              2.6 <span class="strong">Communications</span>. By using the
              Services, you consent to receiving operational emails or SMS

              3.2 Your Content. You retain ownership of content you submit to
              the Services (“Customer Content”). You grant us a worldwide,
              royalty-free licence to host, process, and use Customer Content
              solely to provide and improve the Services. We do not use Customer
              Content to train unrelated foundation models without your consent.
            </p>

              3.3 <span class="strong">Outputs</span>. Subject to payment of
              applicable fees and compliance with these Terms, we grant you a
              non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free licence to use, reproduce,
              display, and commercially exploit AI-generated outputs (“Outputs”)
              for your own projects. You may not resell the Services, distribute
              Outputs as a competing dataset or model, or remove proprietary
              notices.

              3.4 <span class="strong">Third-Party Rights</span>. You are

            <p>
              4.2 Outputs (including cost and timeframe estimates) are estimates
              only and will vary by supplier, region, materials, and site
              conditions.

              4.3 You must verify Outputs with qualified professionals before

              4.5 Consumer Law. Nothing in these Terms excludes or limits rights
              that cannot be excluded under applicable consumer laws. If you are

              months preceding the event giving rise to liability.
            </p>

            <p>
              4.7 You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Progentix Limited,
              its affiliates, directors, officers, employees, and agents from
              any claim, loss, or expense arising out of your use of the
              Services.
            </p>

            <p>
              4.8 Any information provided does not take into account your
              personal objectives, financial situation, or needs. You should

              4.9 From time to time, we may introduce you to third-party service
              providers. These introductions do not constitute endorsements, and

            </p>

            <p>

              6.4 <span class="strong">Late or Failed Payments</span>. If an

              until paid. If payment remains overdue after 3 days’ written
              notice to cure, we may accelerate the balance of the program fee.
            </p>

            <p>
              6.5 <span class="strong">Late Fee</span>. A reasonable late fee
              (currently AUD $60 or local equivalent) may apply where permitted
              by law. We will not charge unlawful or excessive fees.
            </p>

            <p>
              6.6 <span class="strong">Collections and Credit Reporting</span>.
              If amounts remain unpaid after notice, we may refer the account to
              collections and, where lawful, report the default. You agree to
              reimburse reasonable collection costs.
            </p>

            <p>
              6.7 Where the Customer is a corporation, the signatory guarantees
              the Customer’s obligations.
            </p>

            <p>
              6.8 Prices are inclusive of applicable taxes, which will be added
              where required.

            </p>

            <p>
              15.1 Before commencing court proceedings (other than urgent
              injunctive relief), both parties must attempt to resolve disputes
              in good faith through mediation administered by the Hong Kong
              International Arbitration Centre under its Mediation Rules.
            </p>

              15.2 If unresolved within 30 days of mediator appointment, either
              party may proceed under Section 10.
            </p>

            <p>
              15.3 Nothing prevents either party from seeking urgent injunctive
              relief to protect confidential information or intellectual
              property.
