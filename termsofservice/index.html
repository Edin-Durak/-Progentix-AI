              2.1 We may update or amend these Terms from time to time. Any
              material changes will be notified by email or a prominent notice
              on our website. Your continued use of the Services after any

            </p>

            <p>
              2.3 You may only use the Services for lawful purposes and in

            </p>

            <p>
              2.4 You must not attempt to copy, modify, reverse-engineer,

              the Services without our prior written consent.
            </p>

            <h2>3. Intellectual Property</h2>

            <p>
              3.1 All intellectual property rights in the Services, including
              content, software, and data, are owned by Progentix Limited or its

              3.2 You may download, view, or print materials from the Services

              or remove any copyright, trademark, or proprietary notices.
            </p>

            <p>
              3.3 All logos and trademarks used in the Services are owned by
              Progentix Limited or third parties. Nothing in these Terms grants
              you any right or licence to use any logo or trademark without
              prior written consent.
            </p>

            <h2>4. Liability and Indemnity</h2>

            <p>
              4.1 Our Services use artificial intelligence (AI) and may
              incorporate data from third-party providers.
            </p>

            <p>
              4.2 Outputs generated by the Services are for general
              informational purposes only and do not constitute financial,
              legal, property, or professional advice.
            </p>

            <p>
              4.3 You are solely responsible for verifying the accuracy,
              completeness, and suitability of any outputs before relying on
              them.
            </p>

            <p>
              4.4 The Services are provided "as is" and "as available." We make
              no warranties, express or implied, about the accuracy,
              reliability, availability, or suitability of the Services.
            </p>

            <p>
              4.5 To the maximum extent permitted by law, we disclaim all
              liability for any loss, damage, or claim arising from reliance on
              AI-generated or third-party data.
            </p>

            <p>
              4.6 You agree to indemnify and hold harmless Progentix Limited,
              its affiliates, directors, officers, employees, and agents from
              any claim, loss, or expense arising out of your use of the
              Services.
            </p>

            <p>
              4.7 Any information provided does not take into account your
              personal objectives, financial situation, or needs. You should
              seek independent advice from a qualified professional before
              making financial or investment decisions.
            </p>

            <p>
              4.8 From time to time, we may introduce you to third-party service
              providers. These introductions do not constitute endorsements. You
              must undertake your own due diligence before engaging any third
              party.
            </p>

            <h2>5. Third-Party Links</h2>

            <p>
              5.1 The Services may include links to third-party websites,
              content, or services.
            </p>

            <p>
              5.2 We are not responsible for examining or evaluating such
              third-party materials, nor do we warrant their accuracy,
              reliability, or suitability.
            </p>

            <p>
              5.3 We accept no liability for any loss, damage, or harm arising
              from your use of third-party websites or services.
            </p>

            <h2>6. Product and Service Terms</h2>

            <p>
              6.1 By purchasing a product or service from us, you agree to the
              following terms.
            </p>

            <p>
              6.2 The purchase price, as stated on the order form or agreed by
              phone, may be paid in full or by instalments (if approved by us).
            </p>

            <p>
              6.3 Where instalment payments are agreed, the full purchase price
              remains payable and constitutes a debt owed to us.
            </p>

            <p>
              6.4 Payment by instalments is a payment plan, not a subscription
              service.
            </p>

            <p>
              6.5 Failure to make payment by the due date may result in
              suspension or cancellation of Services without refund.
            </p>

            <p>
              6.6 If any instalment is missed, all outstanding amounts become
              immediately due and payable, and a late payment fee of $60 (or
              equivalent in your local currency) may apply.
            </p>

            <p>
              6.7 Where the Customer is a corporation, the signatory guarantees
              the Customer's obligations and indemnifies Progentix Limited
              against losses arising from any breach.
            </p>

            <p>
              6.8 If payment is in default for more than 60 days, we may report
              the default to credit agencies and engage debt collection
              services. You agree to reimburse all associated costs and
              expenses.
            </p>

              to the conditions below.
            </p>

            <p>
              8.3 To qualify, you must submit at least two fully completed
              feasibility analyses per month during the Guarantee Period. Each
              feasibility must be comprehensive and genuine. Incomplete or bulk

            </p>

            <p>
              8.4 Refund requests must be submitted in writing to
              <a href="mailto:info@proptix.ai">info@proptix.ai</a> within 7 days

            </p>

            <p>
              8.5 Refunds will be limited to the total fees paid for the

              external expenses) will not be reimbursed.
            </p>

            <p>
              8.6 Subject to compliance with these conditions, refunds will be
              processed within 14 business days.
            </p>

            <p>
              8.7 No refund is available where you fail to utilise the program
              during the agreed term.
            </p>

            <p>
              9.1 We may suspend or terminate your access to the Services

            </p>

            <p>
              9.2 You may terminate your use of the Services at any time;
