Q: What exactly is Proptix?
A: Proptix is your property operating system. It’s part proptech, part coach, part deal-maker. Think: smart data, instant feasos, and Sage — your AI property coach — walking you through the STRIDE model so you actually do the deals, not just dream about them. Book a demo with the team today.
Q: How does Sage fit in?
A: Sage is the AI coach and mentor built inside Proptix. She looks at your pipeline, gives you your next best move, keeps you accountable, and stops you from stalling. She’s not fluffy “rah-rah” motivation — she’s the tactical voice in your pocket telling you what to do next to move toward a deal.
Q: What’s this STRIDE model I keep hearing about?
A: STRIDE is the battle-tested framework inside Proptix:
Situation and Strategy (Your Gameplan)
Target (Your strategic focal suburb)
Real Estate pipeline (fill your funnel and play the law of averages)
Investigate (Due diligence)
Deal (Negotiation, terms, funding)
Execute (Project manage uplift + exit with profit)
It’s the production line for profitable deals. No random guesswork. No “buy and pray.”

Q: I’ve seen other property software — how is this different?
A: Most tools just spray data at you and say “good luck.” Proptix actually tells you what to do with the data and holds you accountable when executing. It’s the only platform with an AI mentor, Sage, coaching you through STRIDE while doing all the heavy lifting in the background.
Q: Do I need money or experience to start?
A: Nope. Many users start with little to no experience (or capital). That’s why we cover creative finance, JV structures, deposit bonds, and uplift strategies in our Proptix Academy. Our just in time learning helps you structure deals so you can play the game smarter, using other people’s money. Book a demo with the team today.
Q: What if I’m not tech-savvy?
A: If you can open a browser, you can run Proptix. It’s cloud-based, mobile-friendly, and comes with onboarding and step-by-step tutorials. Plus, Sage literally walks you through every stage so you’re never lost. Book a demo with the team today.
Behind the scenes, Proptix is powered by a large language model (LLM) – the same kind of advanced AI that understands and generates human language. That means everything happens in plain English (or any language you speak): you just type or talk, and Sage responds with clear instructions, answers, or documents.
Even better, Proptix includes speech-to-speech with virtually no latency. You can hold a natural conversation with Sage — like talking to a coach in real time — instead of worrying about typing commands or clicking buttons.
Q: Can I really find deals other people miss?
A: Yes. Proptix mines for overlooked, off-market, and value-add opportunities. It spots the cracks where profit hides, surfacing profitable subdivisions, renos, small development site opportunities.

Q: Will this actually help me flip for profit?
A: That’s the whole point. Proptix isn’t a “course” — it’s a property operating system that helps you run real estate like a business, not a hobby. The STRIDE model + Sage coaching + instant feasos = a clear path to banking your first $50k–$250k plus uplift deal. Book a demo with the team today.
Q: What kind of results are people seeing?
A: Members are using Proptix to:
Lock down reno deals under market value.
Pinpoint sites with untapped subdivision value
Run feasos in minutes instead of days.
Negotiate creative offers that get accepted.
Some are beginners landing their first deal. Others are experienced flippers using it to double deal flow.
Q: Can I use this if I’m already experienced?
A: 100%. If you’re already doing deals, Proptix simply 10x’s your deal volume and makes you faster, sharper, and more accurate. Less time buried in spreadsheets, more time banking profits. Book a demo today.

Q: What does it cost?
A: We’ve got tiered plans so you can start lean and scale up. Whether you’re just kicking off or running multiple projects, there’s a plan that fits. Book a demo — we’ll show you where you sit.
Q: Can I get help if I’m stuck?
A: Absolutely. You get onboarding, tutorials, live coaching, and real human support when you need it. Sage handles your daily coaching — our team handles the rest.
Q: Do I need to install anything?
A: No. Proptix is cloud-based. Log in from anywhere. Mobile, desktop, tablet, whatever works for you.
