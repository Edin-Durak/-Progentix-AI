            <p class="mb-1">
              Categories we collect: Identifiers (name, email, phone),
              commercial information (purchases), internet activity (usage,
              device, approximate location), and user-generated content (photos,

              Disclosures for business purposes: We disclose personal

            <h2>Cookies and Consent</h2>

            <p>
              We use cookies and similar technologies to operate the site,

              law (e.g., EU/UK), we obtain your consent via a cookie banner
              before setting non-essential cookies (e.g.,
              analytics/advertising). You can change cookie preferences at any

            <h2>AI, Outputs and Decision-Making</h2>
            <p>
              <span class="bold">AI & Automated Outputs:</span> Our Services
              generate Outputs (e.g., renders, cost estimates, timeframes) using
              AI models. These Outputs are
              <span class="bold">estimates and may contain errors</span>; you
              must verify before relying on them.
            </p>
            <p>
              <span class="bold">Profiling/Automated Decisions:</span> We do not
              make decisions with
              <span class="bold">legal or similarly</span> significant effects
              solely via automated processing. If this changes, we will provide
              required notices and rights (including the right to request human

              their performance. A current list is available on request.
            </p>

            <h2>Security</h2>
            <p>
              We use reasonable technical and organisational measures to protect
              personal information against unauthorised access, loss, or
              alteration, including encryption in transit, access controls, and
              security monitoring. No method is 100% secure; you are responsible
              for keeping your account credentials confidential.
            </p>

            <h2>Retention</h2>
